This repository documents my journey of learning **LangChain** — starting from the basics and going all the way to building **AI Agents**.  
It serves as both a personal learning log and a resource for anyone else beginning with LangChain.

## 📌 What is LangChain?
[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a framework that helps developers build powerful applications with **LLMs (Large Language Models)** by chaining together prompts, tools, memory, and agents.

## 📖 Learning Roadmap
Here’s the path I’ll be following in this repo:

1. **Basics**
   - What is LangChain?  
   - Installing & setting up environment  
   - Simple “Hello World” with an LLM  

2. **Core Concepts**
   - Prompts & PromptTemplates  
   - Chains (Sequential, Simple, LLMChain)  
   - Memory (short-term, long-term)  

3. **Data Augmentation**
   - Working with documents  
   - Vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone, etc.)  
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  

4. **Tools & Integrations**
   - Using APIs as tools  
   - Custom tool creation  

5. **Agents**
   - What are agents?  
   - Agent types (React, Conversational, etc.)  
   - Building custom agents  

6. **Projects**
   - Mini-projects at each stage (e.g., Q&A bot, document chatbot, custom API agent)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

To continue, you’ll need to create a virtual environment and install dependencies:  

```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 2. Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
