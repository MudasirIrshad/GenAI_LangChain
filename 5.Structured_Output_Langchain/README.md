# 📂 Structured Output in LangChain

This folder explains how to get **well-structured outputs from LLMs**.  
Structured outputs are important when working with APIs, agents, or any system that needs **consistent and reliable data**.

---

## 🔑 Approaches Covered
1. **TypedDict** – Lightweight, no validation, trust the LLM  
2. **Pydantic** – With validation, defaults, and auto type conversion  
3. **JSON Schema** – Language-agnostic, validation across different platforms  

---

## 🛠️ When to Use?
- **TypedDict** → Use when you just need structure and trust the model’s output  
- **Pydantic** → Use when you want validation, defaults, and type safety in Python  
- **JSON Schema** → Use when working with multiple languages or cross-system validation

## 📌 Why It Matters
Structured outputs make LLM responses **predictable** and easier to integrate into:  
- APIs  
- Automation workflows  
- Multi-agent systems  
- Data pipelines
