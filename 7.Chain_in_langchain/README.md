# 📘 README: Chains in LangChain

Chains are a core concept in LangChain that allow you to **combine multiple components** (prompts, models, parsers, functions) into a structured workflow.  
They make it easier to build pipelines, reuse logic, and handle complex tasks instead of relying on a single LLM call.

## 🔗 Types of Chains

### 1️⃣ Sequential Chain
- A step-by-step pipeline where the **output of one step becomes the input of the next**.  
- Best for tasks that require multiple transformations or reasoning stages.  
- Example: Generate a report → Summarize the report → Extract key insights.

---

### 2️⃣ Parallel Chain
- Runs **multiple steps at the same time** on the same input.  
- Useful when you need different perspectives or analyses in one go.  
- Example: From a single review, generate sentiment, keywords, and summary simultaneously.

---

### 3️⃣ Conditional Chain
- Chooses a workflow path **based on conditions in the input or output**.  
- Ideal when behavior should change depending on context.  
- Example: If sentiment is positive → craft a thank-you response,  
            If negative → escalate to customer support.

## 🚀 Why Chains?
- Organize and reuse logic effectively.  
- Support **complex workflows** (sequential, parallel, branching).  
- Make pipelines modular, scalable, and easier to debug.  
- Essential when solving tasks that need more than a single LLM call.
